# Damn Spam WordPress Plugin
Damn Spam is a lightweight plugin to help clean up that darned spam. This plugin is highly opinionated and, once activated, will automatically send any comments that contain links in the comment body directly to the spam inbox. Granular settings for deeper control will be added over time.

If you're tired of having to sift through hundreds of comments to find real ones without any links and manually send spammy ones to the spam inbox - then this is the plugin is for you.
